# BeerPoint üç∫

**BeerPoint** is my first web project, created as a semester assignment for the university courses **KIV/WEB** and **KIV/OKS**. The site is focused on developing a simple e-commerce platform for selling beer online.

## About the Project
This project was built as a hands-on introduction to web development and combines front-end and back-end technologies to simulate a real online store. The app handles user accounts, product listings, and order processing.

## Use Cases
The platform supports three main user roles:
- **Administrator** ‚Äì manages the system, user roles, and product inventory.
- **Seller** ‚Äì adds and edits products, handles orders.
- **Customer** ‚Äì browses products, places orders, and manages their cart and profile.


## Database
The site uses a MySQL database. Below is the Entity-Relationship (ER) model:
